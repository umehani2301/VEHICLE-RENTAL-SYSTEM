# 🚗 Vehicle Rental System

Welcome to my beginner-friendly Python console project:  
A mini **Vehicle Rental System** where users can rent **Cars**, **Bikes**, or **Scooters**, choose from available models, enter the number of days, and receive a cleanly formatted rental bill 💸

---

## 💻 Features

✅ Choose between **Car**, **Bike**, or **Scooter**  
✅ Select specific models with fixed per-day pricing  
✅ Enter rental duration and get total cost  
✅ Display detailed **rental bill** with customer info  

This program is purely **menu-driven** and designed to simulate real-world rental logic with conditional statements.
